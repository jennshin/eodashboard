# Providentia

The COVID-19 pandemic has had different impacts in different regions of the world. As part of the is to perform a comparative analysis of the pandemic’s economic impacts in the USA, Asia, and Europe using data from the Earth Observing (EO) Dashboard.

The purpose of Providentia is to investigate whether 
Investigate whether encicormrtn  proxies 
predict areas of the U.S. (and globally, in the future) that will be most affected by Coronavirus via utilizing machine learning tools. By forecasting future severity rates (via our "Hotspot Index"), the model points us towards a better balance of government intervention and economic activity to minimize the negative impact to communities.

 - Act global, PANAL is an app for real-time analysis and forecasting of covid-19 risk. How to deal with exposure with the proposed risk method? is the answer we will solve based on georeferenced points in the shape of a beehive, considering population density, temperature, humidity, socio economic and development index, distance to health care center and current cases of the virus by zone, so you can go out to work and make your food purchases safely but in an alert state with us.
How We Addressed This Challenge
The COVID-19 pandemic has left us vulnerable, due to the lack of real time information to take precautions against the virus daily, even though we live in times where we can request different services such as food, transportation vehicles and even wash our clothes, from our smartphones. Otherwise, science is looking for answers to deal with this pandemic, searching specific solutions, the rapid spread of COVID is challenging everyone with an unknown scenario and many questions.




## How We Addressed This Challenge
Developing a proxy for this challenge required finding datasets that would be able to meet the requirements, specifically (1) identifying variables that could serve as a proxy for air pollution or socioeconomic factor (2) longitudinal data that was collected before and during the pandemic, (3) geographic regions had to include a minimum of 2 out of 3 regions, ie United States, Europe and Asia.


### Proxies
To identify potential variables that would contribute to a proxy for air pollution or socioeconomic impact of covid 19, 

Finding the appropriate datasets proved to be more challenging than originally anticipated for several reasons, including:
- Data was not available for every country and in most cases, coverage of a geographic region, ie the US/Europe/Asia, was spotty 
- Data was  

This section comprises on the details of data, empirical model and estimation technique. 

The primary objective of this study is to establish the link between 

environmental performance, 
ethnic fractionalization, 
institutional quality, 
political freedom and financial development. 


Mobility, transportation,
workforce 
Energy Consumption 

Therefore, following simple model is specified to determine the empirical relationship: 
E = f(NO2, CO2, PM2, MOB, TRAN, WF, EC)

# Research

• Short-term air pollution declines during COVID-19 lockdowns over 34 countries.
• Avoided excess deaths of 49,900 (11,000 to 90,000; 95% confidence interval).
• Avoided excess pediatric asthma emergency room visits of 89,000 (64,700 to 107,000).
